At the hillslope scale, the quantification of contaminant fluxes and concentrations requires a physically based model. This class of model has recently been extended to include coupling between the surface and the subsurface domains for both the water flow and solute transport regimes. Due to their novelty, the relative importance of and interactions between the main model parameters has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, a global Sobol sensitivity analysis is performed on a vineyard hillslope for a one hour intensive rain event with the CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) integrated surface/subsurface model. The event-based simulation involves runoff generation, infiltration, surface and subsurface solute transfers, and shallow groundwater flow. The results highlight the importance of the saturated hydraulic conductivity     K s     and the retention curve shape parameter n and they reveal a strong role for parameter interactions associated with the exchange processes represented in the model. The mass conservation errors generated by the model are lower than 1% in 99.7% of the simulations. Boostrapping analysis of sampling methods and errors associated with the Sobol indices highlights the relevance of choosing a large sampling size (at least N = 1000) and raises issues associated with rare but extreme output results.","2020-01","2021-10-16 11:56:30","2021-10-16 11:56:30","2021-10-16 11:56:30","121","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/APEJDVQG/Gatel et al. - 2020 - Sobol Global Sensitivity Analysis of a Coupled Sur.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/356GR7UG/121.html","","","CATHY model; global sensitivity analysis; hillslope scale; pesticides; reactive solute transfer; Sobol indices; surface/subsurface hydrology; uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although they are being increasingly applied for hydrologic prediction and environmental understanding, very little formal verification and/or benchmarking of these models has been performed. Here we present the results of an intercomparison study of seven coupled surface-subsurface models based on a series of benchmark problems. All the models simultaneously solve adapted forms of the Richards and shallow water equations, based on fully 3-D or mixed (1-D vadose zone and 2-D groundwater) formulations for subsurface flow and 1-D (rill flow) or 2-D (sheet flow) conceptualizations for surface routing. A range of approaches is used for the solution of the coupled equations, including global implicit, sequential iterative, and asynchronous linking, and various strategies are used to enforce flux and pressure continuity at the surface-subsurface interface. The simulation results show good agreement for the simpler test cases, while the more complicated test cases bring out some of the differences in physical process representations and numerical solution approaches between the models. Benchmarks with more traditional runoff generating mechanisms, such as excess infiltration and saturation, demonstrate more agreement between models, while benchmarks with heterogeneity and complex water table dynamics highlight differences in model formulation.

Model description and tests over an energy-limited watershed","Ecohydrology","","1936-0592","10.1002/eco.1362","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1362","The interactions between atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological processes at various spatial and temporal scales are not fully represented in most ecohydrological models. This first of a two-part paper documents a fully integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model consisting of a three-dimensional physically based hydrological model and a land surface model. This first part also presents a first application to test the model over an energy-limited catchment (8.4 km2) of the Sleepers River watershed in Vermont. The physically based hydrological model (CATchment HYdrology, CATHY) describes three-dimensional subsurface flow in variably saturated porous media and surface routing on hillslopes and in stream channels, whereas the land surface model (LSM), an augmented version of Noah LSM with multiple parameterization schemes (NoahMP), accounts for energy, water, and carbon flux exchanges between various land surface elements and the atmosphere. CATHY and NoahMP are coupled through exchanges of water fluxes and states. In the energy-limited catchment of the Sleepers River watershed, where snowmelt runoff generation is the dominant hydrologic flux, the coupled CATHY/NoahMP model at both 90 and 30-m surface grid resolutions, with minimal calibration, performs well in simulating the observed snow accumulation, and melt and subsequent snowmelt discharge. The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency of daily discharge is above 0.82 for both resolutions. The simulation at 90-m resolution shows a marginal improvement over that at 30-m resolution because of more elaborate calibration of model parameters. The coupled CATHY/NoahMP also shows a capability of simulating surface-inundated area and distributed surface water height, although the accuracy of these simulations needs further evaluation. The CATHY/NoahMP model is thus also a potentially useful research tool for predicting flash flood and lake dynamics under climatic change.

This second of a two-part paper first evaluates the performance of a newly developed ecohydrological model over a small semi-arid experimental catchment (7·92 ha) in southeastern Arizona. Secondly, it investigates the effects of soil properties on water subsidy resulting from lateral overland flow re-infiltration and on overall ecohydrological response. With optimized parameters, the model shows a higher ability to simulate surface energy and water fluxes than CO2 fluxes at all temporal scales. The model simulates observed CO2 fluxes fairly well at diurnal scales during the main growing seasons and the interannual variability of these fluxes in response to soil moisture variations from drought years to wet years. However, the model reproduces less well carbon assimilation in spring and positive CO2 flux pulses following early monsoon rain events, suggesting a need for further development of the model's representations of multiple plant species and soil carbon decomposition. The model simulates soil moisture at 5 cm much better than at 15 cm mainly because of heterogeneous soil properties. Through five numerical experiments with varying saturated hydraulic conductivity values, it is revealed that the discharge at the outlet of this semi-arid catchment is essentially attributed to lateral overland flow that is generated mainly by infiltration-excess runoff. Subsurface flow plays a minor role in this semi-arid catchment with a very deep groundwater table (>100 m). The model produces wetter soils in lowland areas along stream rills and channels through re-infiltration of lateral overland flow. This water subsidy provides plants with favourable conditions to produce more leaves, CO2, and ET fluxes in lowland areas. Re-infiltration of overland flow over complex terrain may play a role in buffering climatic impacts in a warming climate with fewer but more intense rainfall events in the Southwestern United States.

Predisposition is quantified using the crossing between modeled lifting condensation level (LCL) and convectively grown ABL depth. The LCL-ABL depth crossing is necessary for air saturation but not sufficient for cloud formation and subsequent convective rainfall occurrence. However, such crossing forms the main template for which all subsequent dynamical processes regulating the formation (or suppression) of convective rainfall operate on. If the feedback between surface fluxes and FA conditions is neglected, a reduction in latent heat flux associated with reduced WT levels is shown to enhance the ABL-LCL crossing probability. When the soil-plant system is fully coupled with ABL dynamics thereby allowing feedback with ABL temperature and humidity, FA states remain the leading control on CRP. However, vegetation water stress plays a role in controlling ABL-LCL crossing when the humidity supply by the FA is within an intermediate range of values. When FA humidity supply is low, cloud formation is suppressed independent of surface latent heat flux. Similarly, when FA moisture supply is high, cloud formation can occur independent of surface latent heat flux. In an intermediate regime of FA moisture supply, the surface latent heat flux controlled by soil water availability can supplement (or suppress) the necessary water vapor leading to reduced LCL and subsequent ABL-LCL crossing. It is shown that this intermediate state corresponds to FA values around the mode in observed humidity lapse rates γw (between −2.5 × 10−6 and −1.5 × 10−6 kg kg−1m−1), suggesting that vegetation water uptake may be controlling CRP at the study site.","2015","2021-10-16 12:05:35","2021-10-16 12:05:35","2021-10-16 12:05:35","2283-2297","","4","51","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2014WR016431","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/IMY4GPY5/Bonetti et al. - 2015 - The influence of water table depth and the free at.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/DNVB3MHR/2014WR016431.html","","","groundwater; CATHY; convection; optimization theory; rainfall; transpiration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geophysical methods such as Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) can provide useful indirect information on the hydrological processes occurring in the vadose zone. In this paper, we propose and test an iterated particle filter method to solve the coupled hydrogeophysical inverse problem. We focus on an infiltration test monitored by time-lapse ERT and modeled using Richards equation. The goal is to identify hydrological model parameters from ERT electrical potential measurements. Traditional uncoupled inversion relies on the solution of two sequential inverse problems, the first one applied to the ERT measurements, the second one to Richards equation. This approach does not ensure an accurate quantitative description of the physical state, typically violating mass balance. To avoid one of these two inversions and incorporate in the process more physical simulation constraints, we cast the problem within the framework of a SIR (Sequential Importance Resampling) data assimilation approach that uses a Richards equation solver to model the hydrological dynamics and a forward ERT simulator combined with Archie's law to serve as measurement model. ERT observations are then used to update the state of the system as well as to estimate the model parameters and their posterior distribution. The limitations of the traditional sequential Bayesian approach are investigated and an innovative iterative approach is proposed to estimate the model parameters with high accuracy. The numerical properties of the developed algorithm are verified on both homogeneous and heterogeneous synthetic test cases based on a real-world field experiment.","2015-02-15","2021-10-16 12:05:41","2021-10-16 12:05:41","2021-10-16 12:05:41","37-51","","","283","","Journal of Computational Physics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/AUJADKKP/Manoli et al. - 2015 - An iterative particle filter approach for coupled .pdf","","","Coupled hydro-geophysical inversion; Data assimilation; Electrical Resistivity Tomography; Particle filter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is based on a numerical solution to the 3D Richards equation modified to account for a 3D RWU, trunk xylem, and stomatal conductances. The stomatal conductance is determined by combining a conventional biochemical demand formulation for photosynthesis with an optimization hypothesis that selects stomatal aperture so as to maximize carbon gain for a given water loss. Model results compare well with measurements of soil moisture throughout the rooting zone, of total sap flow in the trunk xylem, as well as of leaf water potential collected in a Loblolly pine forest. The model is then used to diagnose plant responses to water stress in the presence of competing rooting systems. Unsurprisingly, the overlap between rooting zones is shown to enhance soil drying. However, the 3D spatial model yielded transpiration-bulk root-zone soil moisture relations that do not deviate appreciably from their proto-typical form commonly assumed in lumped eco-hydrological models. The increased overlap among rooting systems primarily alters the timing at which the point of incipient soil moisture stress is reached by the entire soil–plant system.","2014-04-01","2021-10-16 12:05:46","2021-10-16 12:05:46","2021-10-16 12:05:46","32-42","","","66","","Advances in Water Resources","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Ecohydrology; Numerical modeling; Optimal leaf conductance; Photosynthesis; Root water uptake; Trees competition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ability to provide a quantitative description of the subsurface hydrological phenomena requires to fully integrate geophysical data into hydrological modeling. Here, we describe a controlled infiltration experiment that was monitored using both electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The experimental site has a simple, well-characterized subsoil structure: the vadose zone is composed of aeolic sand with largely homogeneous and isotropic properties. In order to estimate the unknown soil hydraulic conductivity, we apply a data assimilation technique based on a sequential importance resampling (SIR) approach. The SIR approach allows a simple assimilation of either or both geophysical datasets taking into account the associated measurement uncertainties. We demonstrate that, compared to a simpler, uncoupled hydro-geophysical approach, the coupled data assimilation process provides a more reliable parameter estimation and better reproduces the evolution of the infiltrating water plume. The coupled procedure is indeed much superior to the uncoupled approach that suffers from the artifacts of the geophysical inversion step and produces severe mass balance errors. The combined assimilation of GPR and ERT data is then investigated, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the two datasets. In the case at hand GPR energy propagates in form of a guided wave that, over time, shows different energy distribution between propagation modes as a consequence of the evolving thickness of the wet layer. We found that the GPR inversion procedure may produce estimates on the depth of the infiltrating front that are not as informative as the ERT dataset.","2015-08-01","2021-10-16 12:05:50","2021-10-16 12:05:50","2021-10-16 12:05:50","150-165","","","82","","Advances in Water Resources","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/3GGMV32T/Rossi et al. - 2015 - Coupled inverse modeling of a controlled irrigatio.pdf","","","Electrical resistivity tomography; Ground-penetrating radar; Hydro-geophysical inversion; Infiltration; Vadose zone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a digital elevation model (DEM) of the 112-km2 study area, 583 dishes (covering about 10% of the area) are identified and classified into four geometric types, ranging in size from 2,500 to 22,500 m2, and a with a maximum depth of 2 m.

Special attention is given to the handling of dishes, applying a ""lake boundary-following"" procedure in the topographic analysis, a level pool routing algorithm to simulate the storage and retardation effects of these reservoirs, and a higher hydraulic conductivity in the topmost 3 m of soil relative to non-dish cells in accordance with field observations. Modeling the interactions between the surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes requires careful consideration of the distinction between potential and actual atmospheric fluxes and their conversion to ponding, overland flow, and infiltration, and this coupling is described in some detail. Further consideration is given to the treatment of snow accumulation, snowmelt, and soil freezing and thawing processes, handled via linear and step function variations over the winter months in atmospheric boundary conditions and in upper soil hydraulic conductivities. A 1-year simulation of the entire watershed is used to analyze the water table response and, at the surface, the ponding heads and the infiltration/exfiltration fluxes. Saturation patterns and return flow and seepage fluxes are similar between the dishes and the main channel networks, with, as expected, preferential infiltration in the dishes.","2002-06-01","2021-10-16 12:06:04","2021-10-16 12:06:04","2021-10-16 12:06:04","162-177","","2","42","","Env Geol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/IRXH2VLK/Bixio et al. - 2002 - Modeling groundwater-surface water interactions in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lakes and other topographic depressions are identified and specially treated as part of the preprocessing procedures applied to the digital elevation data for the catchment. Threshold-based boundary condition switching is used to partition potential (atmospheric) fluxes into actual fluxes across the land surface and changes in surface storage, thus resolving the exchange fluxes, or coupling, between the surface and subsurface modules. Nested time stepping allows smaller steps to be taken for typically faster and explicitly solved surface runoff routing, while a mesh coarsening option allows larger grid elements to be used for typically slower and more compute-intensive subsurface flow. Sequential data assimilation schemes allow the model predictions to be updated with spatiotemporal observation data of surface and subsurface variables. These approaches are discussed in detail, and the physical and numerical behavior of the model is illustrated over catchment scales ranging from 0.0027 to 356 km2, addressing different hydrological processes and highlighting the importance of describing coupled surface-subsurface flow.","2010","2021-10-16 12:06:12","2021-10-16 12:06:12","2021-10-16 12:06:12","","","2","46","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2008WR007536","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/HUG6CKGZ/Camporese et al. - 2010 - Surface-subsurface flow modeling with path-based r.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/3GUXY4K5/2008WR007536.html","","","boundary condition-based coupling; path-based routing; surface-groundwater interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most studies have so far focused on water flow alone, ISSHMs that include also solute transport are beginning to get attention (e.g., Scudeler et al., 2016, doi:10.5194/hess-20-4061-2016; Gatel et al., 2019, doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.12.006). Numerous numerical challenges are associated with these ""doubly coupled"" systems: correct treatment of surface boundary conditions and other mass and flux exchange terms; appropriate time stepping schemes across subsystems that are characterized by different dynamic time scales and often also widely different numerical discretization approaches; performance assessments that can be highly sensitive to the response variables of interest; and so on. We will illustrate some of these challenges via test case simulations of an experimental hillslope using the CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) model (Camporese et al., 2010, doi:10.1029/2008WR007536; Weill et al., 2011, doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2010.10.001). The boundary condition-based coupling strategy used in this model (Putti and Paniconi, 2004, doi:10.1016/S0167-5648(04)80152-7) has been shown to be mathematically rigorous and mass-conservative for the flow model (Sochala et al., 2009, doi:10.1016/j.cma.2009.02.024). The convergence-based time step adaptation strategy used for the nonlinear flow equation (Paniconi and Putti, 1994, doi:10.1029/94WR02046) is likewise thoroughly tested (e.g., D'Haese et al., 2007, doi:10.1002/fld.1369) and widely used. Nonetheless, these schemes, and analogous approaches used in other ISSHMs, need to be adapted and thoroughly tested for coupled systems that include solute transport.","2020-05-01","2021-10-16 12:07:42","2021-10-16 12:07:42","2021-10-16 12:07:42","12074","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020EGUGA..2212074P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, different numerical approaches have been developed to model the saturated subsurface flow in conjunction with the unsaturated zone soil moisture dynamics. Here, we propose to couple the recently developed hybrid three-dimensional hillslope hydrological model (h3D), which considers a lateral pseudo-two-dimensional saturated zone, with the Noah land surface model with multi-parameterizations (Noah-MP). As Noah-MP is developed for weather and climate studies, it currently does not explicitly represent the sophisticated three-dimensional hillslope processes due to computational constraints. Such processes can lead to pronounced spatiotemporal variability in the water table, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff. By applying the h3D model in Noah-MP, such smaller scale variability can be represented, while remaining computationally efficient. To test procedure, the complex 3D model CATchment Hydrology (CATHY) is utilized to compare the performance of the Noah-MP model with and without using the h3D model. The Noah-MP combined with the h3D model can save computational time by three orders of magnitude compared to the CATHY model. Intrinsically, the computational efficiency of the h3D model provides a promising approach for incorporating hillslope-scale rainfall-runoff processes into Noah-MP. By improving hillslope hydrological processes, such a model can highly increase the accuracy of the water table, soil moisture, runoff, and evapotranspiration compared to the Noah-MP.","2017-12-01","2021-10-16 12:20:20","2021-10-16 12:20:20","2021-10-16 12:20:20","NG43A-0135","","","2017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2017AGUFMNG43A0135A","","","","","1835 Hydrogeophysics; HYDROLOGY; 1833 Hydroclimatology; 4410 Bifurcations and attractors; 4430 Complex systems; NONLINEAR GEOPHYSICS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve the ""good status"" of rivers in Europe required by the Water Framework Directive, modeling tools are necessary to help in the management of pesticides applied in agricultural watersheds. Pesticide transfer can be accelerated or slowed down depending on landscape features, distribution of plots, and spatial and temporal distribution of pesticide applications. Since pesticides interact strongly and nonlinearly with the environment, it is essential to understand the flow paths in the surface and subsurface domains. Modeling should thus take into account all watershed characteristics, in particular soil properties, to help describe properly the risk of contamination of surface water. Physically spatialized models that solve the surface and subsurface flow and transport equations make it possible to represent in fine detail water and pesticide fluxes at any point within the spatial discretization of the system. However, these distributed models depend on a large amount of spatialized parameters that render their practical application difficult. The different processes related to hydrology and pesticides interact in the surface and subsurface and are highly non-linear. Input parameter setting is a complex step and difficult at that scale, due to the high heterogeneity of the system (saturated hydraulic conductivity, humidity, rugosity, etc.) and the uncertainty on many parameters. For example, physico-chemical properties of molecules (adsorption, degradation, etc.) play a key role in their transfer pathways, but they are poorly known in the field and very difficult to measure. The process-based, hydrologic model of coupled surface-subsurface flow CATHY (CATchment HYdrology, [1]) was recently extended to reactive solute transport and evaluated in detail through a global sensitivity analysis [2]. Image data assimilation in the CATHY-pesticides model To help parameterize this type of model, data assimilation methods that combine all of the available information (physical model, data, associated errors) to estimate the input parameters and correct the model can be used. Data assimilation techniques have only very recently been applied in detailed process-based hydrological modeling (e.g., [3] and [4] for the CATHY model) and even more rarely for pesticide transfer. In this study, we develop a Kalman ensemble data assimilation scheme [5] in order to estimate spatialized model parameters and to evaluate the impact that a more detailed parameterization has on pesticide transfer. The data assimilation scheme will pay a special attention to the spatial properties of remote sensing images. Indeed, satellite imagery can potentially be very useful to help overcome the lack of spatial information for the model, due to the highly detailed spatio-temporal information they provide, but they are most often under-exploited by considering pixels as single data [6]. For example, classical DA approaches don't consider correlated noise on observations, defining the observation error covariance matrix as diagonal. This simplified representation makes the numerical resolution easier and can be valid for independent sensors, but images from a same satellite sensor are necessarily affected by spatially correlated errors. This study implements a solution to provide observation error covariance matrices adapted to spatially correlated errors, focusing on the observations operator description, and the definition of distances in the data assimilation scheme [7]. The methodological development for pesticide modeling will be tested on virtual data using twin experiments on a hillslope. The CATHY-Pesticide model setup will be based, however, on a real field experiment in theBeaujolais vineyard region, including a vineyard plot and a vegetative filter strip, in order to stay close to well-known conditions","2018-06-03","2021-10-16 12:24:40","2021-10-16 12:24:40","2021-10-16 12:24:40","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","hal.inrae.fr","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/ZTM2LL4M/Lauvernet et al. - 2018 - Assimilation of image data into a spatialized wate.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/CZFNB94X/hal-02608128.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CMWR 2018 - XXII Computational Methods in Water Resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

La modélisation des systèmes aussi complexes pour la gestion des ressources hydriques est un défi difficile. L'objectif global de ce travail est de contribuer au développement d'une approche de modélisation qui permette l'évaluation de l'impact hydrologique du changement climatique sur deux bassins de la Méditerranée, localisés en Sardaigne. Cette contribution se concentre sur deux sujets principaux: comprendre comment la représentation physique des modèles hydrologiques grave sur l'évaluation de l'impact hydrologique dû au changement climatique sur un bassin avec un climat semi-aride, le Rio Mannu di San Sperate, et montrer comme le modélisation avancé puisse aider à définir de mesures de modération et adaptation dans un système complexe enclin aux événements hydrique extrêmes, le Flumendosa, en conditions de changement climatique. Pour atteindre cet objectif le travail s'articule en trois phases. Les effets du changement climatique sur le bassin du Rio Mannu sont évalués à travers la comparaison des résultats de cinq modèles hydrologiques, CATchment HYdrology (CATHY), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), TIN-based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS), TOPographic Kinematic APproximation and Integration-eXtended (TOPKAPI-X), and Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WASIM), en utilisant comme forçage atmosphérique les données de quatre combinaisons de modèles climatiques globaux (GCM) et régionaux (RCM). Pour évaluer les incertitudes une métrique récemment proposée est utilisée: les résultats des modèles sont comparés pendant une période de référence et future, en utilisant l'index de corrélation de Pearson et le bias de Duveiller. Même si certaines différences existent, en tout les modèles hydrologiques montrent une bonne concordance, et ils répondent de manière semblable à la réduction de la précipitation et à l'accroissement de la température prévu par les modèles climatiques. Il s'attend donc que le bassin dans l'avenir sera sujet à une réduction de la disponibilité de ressource hydrique, avec des conséquences négatives en particulier pour le secteur agricole. Une comparaison détaillée des réponses obtenue sur le même bassin avec trois modèles hydrologique à base physique avec différent degré pour ce qui concerne la représentation des procès physiques et des caractéristiques du terrain, CATHY, TOPKAPI-X, tRIBS, est effectué dans le but de tester la transférabilité des paramètres entre les trois modèles hydrologiques, avec une attention particulière sur les difficultés relevées dans les périodes de calibrage et validation. Tandis que les trois modèles ont répondu de manière semblable pendant la période de calibrage, significatives différences ont été relevées pendant la période de validation, caractérisé par un climat très sec, avec le modèle CATHY, qu'il a produit un très bas décharge. En conséquence, pour obtenir résultats satisfaisants avec le modèle CATHY, l’hypothèse de croûtage de sol a été assumée, sur la base dont la couche premier de sol a été modelée avec une conductibilité hydraulique saturée réduite. Finalement le modèle TOPKAPI-X est implémenté sur un des principaux bassins de la Sardaigne, d'importance stratégique pour le système hydrique de la région, le Flumendosa, afin d’évaluer les effets du changement climatique à plus grande échelle. Le modèle répond avec une diminution des valeurs de décharge, contenu hydrique et évapotranspiration réelle à la réduction de la précipitation et accroissement des températures prévus par les modèles climatiques en donnant aussi support à une scène future de carence de la ressource hydrique dans ce bassin de la zone Méditerranéenne.</p> <h2>Abstract</h2><p>Assessing the hydrologic impacts of climate change is of great importance in the Mediterranean basins, which are heavily sensitive to climate variability, with significant impacts on water resources and hydrologic extremes. Modeling such complex systems to manage water resources and predict hydrologic extremes is a difficult task. The overall aim of the work described in this thesis is to bring a contribution in developing a modeling approach that allows evaluation of local hydrologic impacts of climate changes in two Mediterranean catchments located in Sardinia. This contribution revolves around two main themes: understanding how physical representation of hydrologic models can affect hydrologic impact assessment under climate change on a semi-arid basin of the Mediterranean region, the Rio Mannu catchment, and demonstrating how advanced hydrologic modeling can help in defining adaptation measures in a complex water system, the Flumendosa basin, under climate change. The work to achieve the general objective is elaborated into three stages. The effects of climate change are evaluated on the Rio Mannu catchment through comparison of the results from five hydrologic models, CATchment HYdrology (CATHY), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), TIN-based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS), TOPographic Kinematic APproximation and Integration-eXtended (TOPKAPI-X), and Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WASIM), and using as atmospheric input outputs of four climate global (GCM) and regional (RCM) model combinations. In order to evaluate uncertainties, a recently proposed metric is used: climate and hydrologic models results are compared in terms of agreement with each other in reference and future periods using Pearson correlation values and Duveiller bias. Notwithstanding some differences, overall the five hydrologic models show good agreement, and they respond similarly to the reduced precipitation and increased temperatures predicted by the climate models, lending strong support to a future scenario of increased water shortages for this region of the Mediterranean, with negative consequences especially for the agricultural sector. Detailed comparison of the responses obtained with three physically based hydrologic models, but to varying degrees as regards physical processes and terrain features representation – CATHY, tRIBS, and TOPKAPI-X – on the same catchment is carried out, with the aim to test the transferability of parameters between the three hydrologic models, focusing in particular on the calibration and validation difficulties. While the three hydrologic models responded similarly during the calibration year, significant differences were found for the drier validation period for the CATHY model, which produced very low streamflow. To obtain satisfactory results for the CATHY model, an hypothesis of soil crusting was assumed and the first soil layer was modeled with a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity. Finally, the TOPKAPI-X model is applied on a large Sardinian basin prone to extreme flood events, the Flumendosa basin, to assess the hydrologic impact of climate change at much larger scale. The model responds with decreasing value of discharge, soil water content, and actual evapotranspiration to the reduced precipitation and increased temperature predicted by the climate models, lending strong support to a future scenario of increased water shortages also in this basin of the Mediterranean region.</p> <h2>Riassunto</h2><p>La valutazione dell’impatto idrologico del cambiamento climatico riveste particolare importanza per i bacini del Mediterraneo, sensibili ad eventi idrologici estremi. Modellizzare dei sistemi così complessi per la gestione della risorse idriche è una sfida difficile. L’obiettivo globale di questo lavoro è contribuire allo sviluppo di un approccio modellistico che consenta la valutazione dell’impatto idrologico del cambiamento climatico su due bacini del Mediterraneo localizzati in Sardegna. Questo contributo si focalizza su due temi principali: capire come la rappresentazione fisica dei modelli idrologici incida sulla valutazione dell’impatto idrologico dovuto al cambiamento climatico su un bacino con un clima semi-arido, il Rio Mannu di San Sperate, e dimostrare come la modellizzazione avanzata possa aiutare nel definire misure di adattamento in un sistema idrico complesso incline ad eventi estremi, il Flumendosa, in condizioni di cambiamento climatico. Per raggiungere tale obiettivo il lavoro si articola in tre fasi. Gli effetti del cambiamento climatico sul bacino del Rio Mannu sono stati valutati attraverso il confronto dei risultati di cinque modelli idrologici, CATchment HYdrology (CATHY), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), TIN-based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS), TOPographic Kinematic APproximation and Integration-eXtended (TOPKAPI-X), and Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WASIM), utilizzando come forzante atmosferica gli output di quattro combinazioni di modelli climatici globali (GCM) e regionali (RCM). Per valutare le incertezze è stata utilizzata una metrica recentemente proposta: i risultati dei modelli sono stati comparati durante un periodo di riferimento e futuro, utilizzando l’indice di correlazione di Pearson e il bias di Duveiller. Pur con qualche differenza, complessivamente i modelli idrologici mostrano una buona concordanza tra loro, e rispondono in maniera simile alla riduzione della precipitazione e all’incremento della temperatura previsti dai modelli climatici. Ci si aspetta pertanto che il bacino nel futuro sarà soggetto ad una riduzione della disponibilità di risorsa idrica, con conseguenze negative in particolare per il settore agricolo. È stato effettuato un confronto dettagliato delle risposte ottenute sullo stesso bacino con tre modelli idrologici fisicamente basati di diverso grado per quanto riguarda la rappresentazione dei processi fisici e delle caratteristiche del terreno, CATHY, TOPKAPI-X, tRIBS, con lo scopo di testare la trasferibilità dei parametri tra i tre modelli idrologici, concentrandosi sulle difficoltà riscontrate nei periodi di calibrazione e validazione. Mentre i tre modelli hanno risposto in maniera simile durante il periodo di calibrazione, sono state riscontrate significative differenze durante il periodo di validazione, caratterizzato da un clima molto secco, con il modello CATHY, che ha prodotto una portata molto bassa. Pertanto, per ottenere risultati soddisfacenti con il modello CATHY, è stata assunta l’ipotesi di soil crusting, sulla base della quale il primo strato di suolo è stato modellato con una ridotta conducibilità idraulica satura. Infine il modello TOPKAPI-X è stato implementato su uno dei principali bacini sardi di importanza strategica per il sistema idrico della regione, il Flumendosa, per valutare gli effetti del cambiamento climatico a scala maggiore. Il modello risponde con una diminuzione dei valori di portata, contenuto idrico ed evapotraspirazione reale alla riduzione della precipitazione ed incremento della temperature previsto dai modelli climatici, dando supporto ad uno scenario futuro di carenza della risorsa idrica anche in questo bacino dell’area Mediterranea.</p>","2018","2021-10-16 12:26:26","2021-10-16 12:26:26","2021-10-16 12:26:26","","182","","","","","","","","","","Università degli Studi di Cagliari - Université du Québec, Institut national de la recherche scientifique","Italie - Québec","en","","phd","","","espace.inrs.ca","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/TVKHUD2X/Perra - 2018 - A comparative assessment of hydrologic models of v.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses the spatially distributed CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) model to explore how the frequency of daily rainfall (λ) can affect the hydrologic regime of intermittent catchments. After a multi-objective calibration and validation of CATHY against experimental measurements of streamflow and groundwater levels in a catchment used as a pasture, the role of λ in affecting streamflow characteristics was explored using different scenarios. With different values of λ for the dry and wet periods of the year, CATHY showed that a series of frequent rainfall events was often associated with incipient streamflow, independent of the season. Activation of streamflow during the wet season was related to multiple factors and was not often associated with the shallow groundwater levels near the outlet of the catchment. The interplay between rainfall depth and intensity acted as the most important factor for the generation of streamflow. Using the difference between accumulated rainfall and evapotranspiration as a measure of wetness, saturated subsurface flow mechanism generated streamflow in simulations with wetness at least three times larger than mean wetness of other simulations. Although groundwater uprise near the outlet did not effectively contribute to streamflow in the initial days of flow, it strongly correlated with the magnitude of the runoff coefficient. Values of λ close or equal to the maximum value in the wet season can sustain the connectivity between groundwater and streamflow in the riparian zone. This connectivity increases the catchment wetness, which consequently results in an increase of the generated streamflow. Our study showed that rainfall regimes characterized by different λ were able to identify distinct flow regimes typical of either intermittent, ephemeral, or nonflowing catchments. Decrease of λ in the wet season is likely associated with a reduction of streamflow, with a shift of flow regime from intermittent to ephemeral or no-flow.","2020","2021-10-16 12:29:36","2021-10-16 12:29:36","2021-10-16 12:29:36","615-632","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.13610","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/G2XM5T5S/Azarnivand et al. - 2020 - Simulated response of an intermittent stream to ra.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/HTGCY35E/hyp.html","","","CATHY model; integrated surface–subsurface hydrological modelling; intermittent catchments; rainfall frequency; stochastic scenarios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their ability to correctly reproduce the response of hydrological systems to natural and anthropogenic forcing depends largely on the accuracy of model parameterization, including the level of detail in the representation of the bedrock. This latter is typically incorporated in some way via the bottom boundary of the model domain. Issues of bedrock topography, variable soil depth, and the resulting hillslope storage distribution representation in ISSHMs are vitally important but to date have received little attention. A standard treatment of the bottom boundary, especially in large catchment and continental scale applications, is to model it as a flat or inclined (e.g., parallel to the surface) impermeable base (sometimes with some simple leakage term). This approach does not allow the model to correctly reproduce bedrock-controlled threshold responses such as the fill and spill process, as observed across many hillslope and catchment scale field studies. It is still unclear whether Richards equation-based numerical models are actually able to generate such responses. Here we use a Richards equation-based model (CATHY) to simulate internal transient subsurface stormflow dynamics observed at the well-characterized Panola experimental hillslope in Georgia (USA). Soil and bedrock properties were calibrated starting from values reported in previous studies at the site. Our simulation results show that the model was able to reproduce threshold mechanisms, which in turn affected both the integrated and distributed hydrologic responses of the Panola hillslope. We then developed a set of virtual experiments with modified boundary conditions and base topography at the soil-bedrock interface to explore the bedrock boundary control on transient groundwater flow patterns. Our results show that accurate representation of the lower boundary is crucial for ISSHM simulations of hillslope-scale storm runoff and for connectivity of transient groundwater. We summarize our findings with the development of a new bedrock topographic wetness index that takes into account the unsaturated infiltration dynamics. The index is able to help represent the spatial variability of water table response over the bedrock surface compared to standard surface topography-based indices. This new index may be useful in larger-scale ISSHM applications where an exact bedrock topography representation is not feasible or possible.","2019","2021-10-16 12:30:56","2021-10-16 12:30:56","2021-10-16 12:30:56","8445-8462","","11","55","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019WR025726","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/A5EC7RTM/Camporese et al. - 2019 - Fill and Spill Hillslope Runoff Representation Wit.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/PVLVXKYY/2019WR025726.html","","","CATHY; bedrock; fill and spill; ISSHM; Panola","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These equations depend on parameters that, in most cases, can be measured and, theoretically, transferred across different types of DHMs. The aim of this study is to test the potential of parameter transferability in a real catchment for two contrasting periods among three DHMs of varying complexity. The case study chosen is a small Mediterranean catchment where the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) model was previously calibrated and tested. The same datasets and parameters are used here to apply two other DHMs—the TOPographic Kinematic Approximation and Integration model (TOPKAPI) and CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) models. Model performance was measured against observed discharge at the basin outlet for a one-year period (1930) corresponding to average wetness conditions for the region, and for a much drier two-year period (1931–1932). The three DHMs performed comparably for the 1930 period but showed more significant differences (the CATHY model in particular for the dry period. In order to improve the performance of CATHY for this latter period, an hypothesis of soil crusting was introduced, assigning a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity to the top soil layer. It is concluded that, while the physical basis for the three models allowed transfer of parameters in a broad sense, transferability can break down when simulation conditions are greatly altered.","2019-11","2021-10-16 12:32:52","2021-10-16 12:32:52","2021-10-16 12:32:52","2261","","11","11","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/IULSPPH7/Perra et al. - 2019 - Investigating Parameter Transferability across Mod.pdf","","","distributed hydrologic models; Mediterranean region; parameter transferability; physically based models; runoff modeling; soil crusting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, data assimilation has been recently the focus of much attention also for physically-based integrated hydrological models, whereby multiple terrestrial compartments (e.g., snow cover, surface water, groundwater) are solved simultaneously, in an attempt to tackle environmental problems in a holistic approach. Recent examples include the joint assimilation of water table, soil moisture, and river discharge measurements in catchment models of coupled surface-subsurface flow using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). One of the typical assumptions in these studies is that the measurement errors are uncorrelated, whereas in certain situations it is reasonable to believe that some degree of correlation occurs, due for example to the fact that a pair of sensors share the same soil type. The goal of this study is to show if and how the measurement error correlations between different observation data play a significant role on assimilation results in a real-world application of an integrated hydrological model. The model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) is applied to reproduce the hydrological dynamics observed in an experimental hillslope. The physical model, located in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering of the University of Padova (Italy), consists of a reinforced concrete box containing a soil prism with maximum height of 3.5 m, length of 6 m, and width of 2 m. The hillslope is equipped with sensors to monitor the pressure head and soil moisture responses to a series of generated rainfall events applied onto a 60 cm thick sand layer overlying a sandy clay soil. The measurement network is completed by two tipping bucket flow gages to measure the two components (subsurface and surface) of the outflow. By collecting data at a temporal resolution of 0.5 Hz (relatively high, compared to the hydrological dynamics), we can perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the observations, including the cross-correlations between data from different sensors. We report on the impact of taking these correlations into account in a series of assimilation scenarios, where the EnKF is used to assimilate pressure head and/or soil moisture and/or subsurface outflow.","2017-04-01","2021-10-16 12:33:10","2021-10-16 12:33:10","2021-10-16 12:33:10","6726","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2017EGUGA..19.6726C","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/M6XW4Z9E/Camporese and Botto - 2017 - On the importance of measurement error correlation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains difficult to collect reliable data necessary for understanding and modeling these Earth system processes in real catchments. To overcome this problem, controlled experiments are being conducted at the Landscape Evolution Observatory at Biosphere 2, The University of Arizona. Previous experiments have revealed differences in hydrological response between 2 landscapes within Landscape Evolution Observatory, even though both landscapes were designed to be identical. In an attempt to discover where the observed differences stem from, we use a fully 3-dimensional hydrological model (CATchment HYdrology) to show the effect of soil water retention characteristics and saturated hydraulic conductivity on the hydrological response of these 2 hillslopes. We also show that soil water retention characteristics can be derived at hillslope scale from experimental observations of soil moisture and matric potential. It is found that differences in soil packing between the 2 landscapes may be responsible for the observed differences in hydrological response. This modeling study also suggests that soil water retention characteristics and saturated hydraulic conductivity have a profound effect on rainfall–runoff processes at hillslope scale and that parametrization of a single hillslope may be a promising step in modeling rainfall–runoff response in real catchments.","2018","2021-10-16 12:33:56","2021-10-16 12:33:56","2021-10-16 12:33:56","2118-2127","","13","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.13148","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/TIMZL7D3/van den Heuvel et al. - 2018 - Effects of differential hillslope-scale water rete.pdf; /home/ben/Zotero/storage/EGYGEM54/hyp.html","","","Biosphere 2; hydrological 3D modeling; landscape evolution; rainfall–runoff response; soil characteristics; soil water retention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These areas create important corridors to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity and provide environmental and social services essential to the quality of life of urban dwellers [1]. Urban expansion on natural ecosystems, in addition to reducing the extent of the vegetation cover, changes the ecosystem hydrologic regime. The increase of impervious surfaces and the introduction of drainage infrastructure reduce the volume of water inﬁltrating soils, and hence soil moisture and groundwater recharge, decreasing the water available to sustain vegetation growth and health [2]. Moreover, urbanization creates unique biotic communities where pockets of remaining native vegetation and introduced non-native species may coexist, having occasionally higher water demand, diﬀerent patterns of evapotranspiration (ET), interception, and inﬁltration [3].","","2021-10-16 12:34:12","2021-10-16 12:34:12","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/JWWV7LQW/Marchionni and Camporese - Eco-hydrological model of water dynamics in a smal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydrological model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) was used here to simulate the effects that different degrees of progressive conversion from pasture to plantation have on the streamflow generation in intermittent streams. The model was applied to two rural catchments with different size and topographic features in southwest Victoria, Australia. Simulated scenarios included different levels of plantation establishment in pasture areas planting gradually from downslope to upslope and vice versa. Different models for root water uptake were compared to account for water stress, oxygen stress, and root water compensation. A function of root growth over time was also explored to see how it affected model results. The model results show that complex interactions between topographic features and afforestation patterns are crucial in controlling catchments hydrological behavior. In particular, results show that planting in the prone-saturation areas has the largest effects on streamflow. Oxygen stress has a more significant impact than root water compensation on streamflow changes. A time dependent root growth results in smaller streamflow reduction on average, although with different impacts on the two catchments, also due to the interplay between topography and plantation patterns. Overall, our results show that there are multiple factors affecting the water balance when a catchment is partially or completely afforested and those must be taken into account when implementing forestry management strategies.","2020-08-01","2021-10-16 12:34:34","2021-10-16 12:34:34","2021-10-16 12:34:33","138748","","","728","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/ben/Zotero/storage/G2TTJ7V8/Azarnivand et al. - 2020 - Modeling hydrological impacts of afforestation on .pdf","","","Afforestation; Integrated hydrological modeling; Intermittent streams; Land-use; Subsurface-surface water interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model 1 uses a uniform distribution for the entire root zone; Model 2, a nonlinear root density distribution function; and Models 3 and 4, two configurations of exponential root water uptake distribution. When comparing simulation results with and without a root water extraction module, we observed that Model 1 produces reasonable reductions in tile-drain and edge-of-field flows. Further analysis indicates that edge-of-field flow is more affected by the root water extraction module than tile-drain flow.
